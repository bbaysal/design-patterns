## Structural Patterns

This project is include structural pattern implementations

### Adapter Pattern

Commonly, the adapter pattern is used for dealing wit legacy codes. It is noteced that the functionality of the program should not be changed in the adapter implementation. 

### Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern is used to decouple abstraction and implementation. When the system has orthogonal dimensions and we want to separate these to avoid the combinational crashes of the classes., the bridge pattern is suitable for this scenario.

Some drawbacks of this pattern are can increase the complexity and it is hard to design it conceptually. 

### Composite Pattern

It deals with the tree structure and intends that a leaf and composite to have the same interface. It is structured so that the components either the leaf or the individual object are the same. They are designed to have the same operators and functions.

### Decorator Pattern

The decorator pattern is used for adding the functionality of each level of the hierarchy without breaking down the other part of the system. IT addicts to the single responsibility principle in the OOP. 

The behavior of the parts of the system can be composed to decorate the classes.
